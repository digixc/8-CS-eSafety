- In the UK we have three main laws to protect us:
  - Computer Misuse Act (1990)
  - Data Protection Act (1998)
  - Copyright, Designs and Patents Act (1988)

- Look at the scenarios below: 
- If you were a network manager at a school, would you report the matter to the police? Which parts, if any, of the Computer Misuse Act 1990 have been broken? Explain fully.
   - A student, without permission, comes into school during the holidays and logs on to the network using another student’s password. She surfs the internet for an hour and then logs off.
   - A student writes and sends a simple virus that will send hundreds of emails from the account of anyone who receives it. 
   - A student sits down at a workstation, and finds that the last user has not logged off after ordering goods from amazon.co.uk. The student places an order, using the credit card number that is still onscreen, but changes the delivery address to his or her own.
   - A student hacks into the school computer network from home. Using the Management Information system, the student changes their own personal details, and those of a friend.
- Add you thoughts on each case to your answers for the CMA work.

- Computer users, who carefully lock their front door when they leave home, are often not as careful when it comes to using computers. 
- What advice would you give to a new computer user about: user names and passwords, credit card details, cookies, logging on and logging off?

- How many of the following have you done?
    - Copying a computer game from a friend
    - Downloading some music from the web
    - Copying text from a website and pasted it into your own work
- Come on, if we tell the truth, I bet we have all done these things. 

 *But does it really matter?*
- It is estimated that almost 40% of software is copied. In some countries it is over 90%!
- This has a huge impact on the software industry.
- The 2011 Business Software Alliance Piracy Study Standard, estimates the total commercial value of illegally copied software to be at $59 billion in 2010.
- By just cutting the software piracy rate from 40% to 30% would result in an extra 40,000 jobs in the IT sector and an extra £2.5 billion in tax revenues.
- The extra revenue that software companies would receive would mean that they could reinvest more into new products such as games and apps.
- It’s estimated, in fact, that people breaking the law and downloading copyrighted music costs the industry something like £8.5 billion a year – and loses £1.5 billion for the VAT man.
