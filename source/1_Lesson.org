 *What is sexting?*

- Sexting is when someone sends or recieves a sexually explict message through their mobile phone or webcam.
- This maybe in the form of an image, text or a video and is sometimes called cybersex or sending a nudie.   
- It maybe naked pictures or 'nudes', underwear shots or dirty pics.

 *Why do people send them?*

- pressure to prove their sexuality
- everyone else is doing it
- threatening or blackmailed into doing it
- to show you trust or love someone
- proud of your body and want to share it 
- in a long distance or online relationship

 *What are the dangers?*

- Not harmless
- It's illegal. If you are under 18 the law sees you as a child. If you have indecent images or videos of someone - even if you are the same age - this is an offence under the Protection
 of Children Act 1978 and the Criminal Justice Act 1988. 
- No control on how they are used or shared - once it is out there it is 'out' there.
- Vulnerable to blackmail, bullying, unwanted attention and emotional distress

*What to do if you feel pressured?*

- Report it - this link shows how to report on various types of social media [[http://www.childnet.com/resources/how-to-make-a-report][Childnet]] or [[http://www.ceop.police.uk/safety-centre/11-16/][CEOP]]
- Speak to someone either an adult in your life or pick up the phone to Childline on 0800 1111 or on their website [[https://www.childline.org.uk/Explore/OnlineSafety/Pages/Sexting.aspx][Childline]]
- Block them
- Don't give in to pressure - once you have pressed send you can't take it back.
